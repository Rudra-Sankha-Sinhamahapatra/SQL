KEYS:

PRIMARY KEY: unique id ,cant be null,there can be only primary key.
suppose in the table there is two components in the table
roll no and name then only one can be primary key
we will take roll no as our primary key because roll no of every
person will be different.

FOREIGN KEYS: foreign key is a column (or set 
of columns ) in a table that refers to the primary key.
There can be multiple Foreign keys..Foreign keys can have duplicate
& null values.
